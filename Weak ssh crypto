Given the reported vulnerabilites for each algorithm, the solution would be to remove the weaknesses from sshd_config

Navigate to the configuration file of ssh - cd /etc/ssh

Open the configuration file for editing with elevated privilage - sudo nano sshd_config

Go to the line beneath the page that needs changing

For the ssh_weak_macs flag - delete the weak algorithm hmac-md5-96

For the ssh_weak_kex - delete diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 

For ssh_weak_ciphers - delete 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes256-cbc
