We are required to 
Take down the telnet service.
Take down the service in port 69/udp.


To get the cleartext service running on port 69/udp - sudo nmap -sU -p 69 "server-ip"

Itâ€™s worth mentioning that on Ubuntu/Debian machines, inetd is the service that listens on all ports used by Internet services such as FTP, POP3, and telnet. And, it starts automatically at boot.

All we need to do is to stop the service from running and the flag will be available.  - sudo systemctl stop inetd

Once that is done, flag will be available.
