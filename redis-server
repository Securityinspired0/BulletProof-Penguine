Navigate to the configuration location of the redis-server. 

The configuration file is typically located in the Redis configuration directory, which is usually /etc/redis/redis.conf on most Linux distributions.

The command to give the user a permission the ability to read and write the file - sudo chmod 600 redis.conf 

We have to Set a password using the "requirepass" directive in "redis.conf".

Open the file with a text editor - nano redis.conf

Go to the security module where you'll find the requirepass directive commented out, It's almost beneath the page

Example of what to find - #requirepass foobared. Remove the # change the footbared to your preferable password and save the the file.

Restart the server - sudo systemctl restart redis-server

Connect to the redis server - redis-cli

Authentication with the password - AUTH <your_password>

You should see "OK."

exit the redis-server - exit

To get your flag, Use this command - get_flags

Viola.
